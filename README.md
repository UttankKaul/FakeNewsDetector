# FakeNewsDetector
This project was inspired by an article that I read, that made me realise the amount of fake news floating around the intenet. This project will help anyone to find fake news using a standard data set. 


Instructions to use the code:- 
1. Use jupiter notebook or any IDE that can run jupyter LAB.
2. Check the environemt before running the code (Check Py version, should be > 3.7)
3. Use the RAW file in this format :- ![Fornat CSV](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69110483/117410654-57b98880-af30-11eb-8e0d-fcf48a63ee7e.png)

FORMAT :- (Check the SS above)
Col 1 : WC :- word count
Col 2 :- Title of the article
Col 3 :- text of the article. 

Expected Outcome :- 
1. Accuracy percentage
